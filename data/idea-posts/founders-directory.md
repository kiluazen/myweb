- Wanted to figure out which startups I should plot my way to work at. Every idea sounds great on their websites, but the founding team usually decides the work culture and future of the product. So went on search for growing companies with second time founders, couldn't put together something like that.

- Talked to couple of people in Accel, Chiratae Ventures etc.. The feedback was, They always start from the market, then searching for companies who are in that space and then they look at the team. It's not a founding team first approach.

- An adjacent idea popped up to have a directory of top ai engineers from hugging face, kaggle etc.. This was dismissed when talking to Akul our growth, sales guy showed me some tools he would use for this. And to the 20 Talent Recruiters I approached none replied so didnt' move further here.
