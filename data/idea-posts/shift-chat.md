- I have it working gotta publish it to the chrome store.
- You will have a little icon floating when you are on claude.ai or chatgpt.com or perplexity.ai
- You click on the icon and go anywhere you want and cmd+v it.
- Overtime using chatgpt, claude, perplexity I have developed certain roles them. 
    - If I want code and techincal understanding I go to Claude
    - If I want to brainstorm + search web I go to ChatGPT
    - If I want simple answeres I go to Perplexity
- Often when I am in claude I find myself wondering Aah this coversation would be better in chatgpt because of the browseweb feature / memory etc..
- So for that i built this extension so You can move around places taking the chat wherever you want.
