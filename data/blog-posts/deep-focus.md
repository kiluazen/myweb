I was listening to a podcast on Alexander Hamilton, it was awesome. He studies something and walks around thinking about it, takes a 8hr sleep wakes up and starts writing 6 hrs straight with just coffee. This is guy one of the most productive people of the history a founding father of America.

That is what people call deep focus that I haven’t experienced in a long time, ever since jee.

That is a really sad statement to put out. In my work days if I want to have such 6 hr long working focus. I should probably be in the office by 930 that will make it a 5hr focus time for me. I think 9 is ideally a good time for me to wake up anyway. So sleep 12:30 I suppose, for some reason sleep 1230 doesn’t seem sustainable to me.

Ideally my blog life should be I read and consume a lot about a lot in the week, and I do the 6-hr non stop thing like Hamilton thing with coffee on Saturday.Edit it on Sunday and publish, That seems ideal to me.

I read Leopold Aschenbrenner blogs which I will continue reading. He is an amazing guy. One of the reason he was communicating effectively on the pod is because he wrote a 150 page thesis explaining on how he thinks the future will play out, that is a lot of compute and he merely was repeating many of things he has written there.
So it’s a good assumption to make if someone is such an effective communicator of their ideas like Peter Theil, it’s probably because they write and allow themselves to think in full sentences
