I was listening to a podcast on [Alexander Hamilton](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1iCV37xWKWVSGyVn17heV8?si=1528de1fe68643de), it was awesome. He was a ferocious writer. His work routine caught my attention.
He studies something and walks around thinking about it, goes to bed, wakes up and starts writing 6 hrs straight with just coffee. 

I see the benefits of this too, ever since i stopped breakfast and delayed my lunch to 3 pm. I get a lot of time for focused work in the morning from 1030 to 230 nearly. With just coffee, especially when I have figured out what exactly to do, those sessions are very fruitful. 

That is what people call deep focus that I haven’t experienced in a long time, ever since JEE days.

That is a really sad statement to put out.

I read [Leopold Aschenbrenner](https://forourposterity.com/) blogs which I will continue reading. He is an amazing guy. One of the reason he was communicating effectively on the pod is because he wrote a 150 page thesis explaining on how he thinks the future will play out, that is a lot of compute and he merely was repeating many of things he has written there.

It is also the same with why all the Peter Theil interview's are filled with such high density information, It's cause he spent a lot of time thinking and writing his book.

So it’s a good assumption to make if someone is such an effective communicator of their ideas like Peter Theil, it’s probably because they write and allow themselves to think in full sentences.

I was wondering about this cause, when I try to communicate my ideas they are not concise or effectively understood by the other person. I often just go on talking with myself confusing the other person entirely. 
I was reflecting on this and decided, if I were to communicate an idea to someone I must write it down and have an argument of different directions once with myself. So my conversations with other's on that subject matter would be effective.
