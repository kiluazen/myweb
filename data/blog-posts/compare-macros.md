It started when i was looking to find a replacement for banana. I was doing a cut at the time.
I wanted a more fiborous fruit with lower calories.

I went through healthifyme typing apple, orange , kiwi. And then wait what was the fibre for apple again etc.

So started looking for a tool that shows comparision between two food items in a clean table.
Couldnt' find one so I built one.

Checkout https://comparemacros.netlify.app/

It needs a little more UI work, But that's the idea.

If people will find it useful I will improve it.
