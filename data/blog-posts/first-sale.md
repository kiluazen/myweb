I saw this toy on [Twitter](https://x.com/Rainmaker1973/status/1806233611823182161) - it's an interlocking cone. I loved the way it was moving and thought I'd buy it. 

Then I thought, why not make it myself? I had zero experience in building a CAD model or 3D printing. But I decided to give it a shot.

I chatted with Claude and decided to write the logic in OpenSCAD. I started reading their documentation - what's linear_extrude, what's $fn, and all that stuff.

I submitted a design to an online 3D printing service. That first attempt utterly failed. I stared at that first object, made some changes, and boom - v2 worked! It was awesome, it was as cool as it looked on twitter.

Something cool happened. I went to a hackerhouse, and this guy named Aadhi loved it so much he bought it from me on the spot. You can check out what I've made at https://kushalsm.com/products

Since then, I've designed three other toys and sell them on my website for anyone interested.
- Interlcoking Heart
- Calabi-Yau Manifold
- Ruleaux Tetrahedron

Next, I want to market them by making reels and stuff like that.
Because everyone I showed it to thought it was very cool and were willing to buy one for a fair praise.

Then I realised I wouldn't have known I wanted one until I was that tweet. So the way to sell these things is through content and getting this product infront of people's face. Cause no one's going to etsy looking for an interlcoking cone.

It felt awesome and gave me confidence that I can create things people actually want to buy.
