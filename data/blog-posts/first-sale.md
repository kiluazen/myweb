I saw this toy on Twitter - it's an interlocking helical cone. I loved the look and thought I'd buy it, but it was too expensive. 

Then I thought, why not make it myself? I had zero experience in building a CAD model or 3D printing. But I decided to give it a shot.

I chatted with Claude and decided to write the logic in OpenSCAD. I started reading their documentation - what's linear_extrude, what's $fn, and all that stuff.

I submitted a design to an online 3D printing service. That first attempt utterly failed. I stared at that first object, made some changes, and boom - v2 worked! It was awesome, it was as cool as it looked on twitter.

Something cool happened. I went to a hackerhouse, and this guy named Aadhi loved it so much he bought it from me on the spot. You can check out what I've made at https://kushalsm.com/products

Since then, I've designed three other toys and sell them on my website for anyone interested.
- Interlcoking Heart
- Calabi-Yau Manifold
- Ruleaux Tetrahedron

Next, I want to market them by making reels and stuff like that.
It felt awesome and gave me confidence that I can create things people actually want to buy.
